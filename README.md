# Implementation-of-2-D-convolution-and-2-D-FFT-functions
* For 2D Convolution, I created a padding function from scratch which implements four types of paddings (clip/zero-padding, wrap around, copy edge, and reflect across edge) and tested the convolution function on various types of filters like Box, Sobel and Roberts filters.
* The 2D FFT was implemented using an inbuilt 1-D FFT function.
* A 2D IFFT has also been implemented here.
